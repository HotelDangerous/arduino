This is my **first project with the Arduino UNO**. Provided are both the schematic *-showing how the hardware is set up-* and the sketch *-the software and logic that drives the program*.

In this project we use a *digital input* to toggle an LED on and off. What you need for this project is:
- 1 Arduino
- 1 Breadboard
- 1 560 Ohm resistor
- 1 10 kOhm resistor
- 1 100 nF capacitor
- Connection wires
