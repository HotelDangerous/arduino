# Arduino
This repository is a digital record of my process learning to use the Arduino, and introduction to robotics. Each 
of the subdirectories in this directory are independent projects. Each project contains all the code and information
(*schematics*, *parts*, *etc...*) needed to complete that project.

```c++
void post_script(){
  std::cout << "The Arduino repository is complementary to my goal of learning c++.\n";
}
// TODO: Learn C++ and get better at Robotics / Arduino
```
