# Traffic Light Simulation
The code and schematic presented in this folder are used to create a traffic light simulation with an Arduino Uno. The light changes when a vehicle is waiting at a red light (when the corresponding button is pressed).
There is time between each color change, a minimum green light time, and a brief few seconds where all lights are red to allow through traffic. The code is heavily commented to explain further.
